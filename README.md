Initially Type Indexes were discussed and worked on together with the webId profile spec. During this work we came to conclusion to separate the index topic from the webId profile. The igniting issue is documented [here](https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/issues/35) and decision discussions were conducted at the WebID weekly meetings respectively [here](https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/blob/main/meetings/2022-08-23.md#separation-of-index-content) and [here](https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/blob/main/meetings/2022-08-30.md#separation-of-index-content).

Further conversation on this work is discussed on the WebId profile gitter chat and weekly meetings. Feel free to open a GitIssue in this repo if you want to contribute or have a remark/improvement suggestion/concern.
